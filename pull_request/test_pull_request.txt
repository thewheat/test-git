Outline
=======
1. Forked Corner Geeks Repo (https://github.com/CornerGeeks/test-git)
2. Cloned my fork (https://github.com/thewheat/test-git) to my computer
3. Add remote to original source (typically called "upstream")
       git remote add upstream https://github.com/CornerGeeks/test-git
4. Added this file
5. Commit this file
6. After commit fetch changes from upstream and merge
       git fetch upstream
       git merge upstream/master master
7. Fix any conflicts (if necessary) and commit
8. Go to my fork's pull request page and click "New pull request" https://github.com/thewheat/test-git/pulls
9. By default, base fork, base, head fork and compare are selected. If not below are the typical settings
       base fork: CornerGeeks/test-git (i.e. upstream repo to submit pull request to)
       base     : master
       head fork: My repo thewheat/test-git
       compare  : master
10. Ensure that that there is the "Able to merge", "These branches can be automatically merged" message. 
    If not, you probably didn't did a git fetch upstream, git merge upstream/master master (and fix conflicts and commit if necessary)
    While you can still submit the pull request, the maintainer will have to manually merge your code which can be annoying and/or error prone and is not nicely looked upon
