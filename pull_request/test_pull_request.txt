1. Forked Corner Geeks Repo (https://github.com/CornerGeeks/test-git)
2. Cloned my fork (https://github.com/thewheat/test-git) to my computer
3. Add remote to original source (typically called "upstream")
       git remote add upstream https://github.com/CornerGeeks/test-git
4. Added this file
5. Commit this file
6. After commit fetch changes from upstream and merge
       git fetch upstream
       git merge upstream/master master
7. Fix any conflicts (if necessary) and commit
8. Go to my fork's pull request page and click "New pull request" https://github.com/thewheat/test-git/pulls
9. By default, base fork, base, head fork and compare are selected. If not below are the typical settings
       base fork: CornerGeeks/test-git (i.e. upstream repo to submit pull request to)
       base     : master
       head fork: My repo thewheat/test-git
       compare  : master
10. Ensure that that there is the "Able to merge", "These branches can be automatically merged" message. 
    If not, you probably didn't did a git fetch upstream, git merge upstream/master master (and fix conflicts and commit if necessary)
